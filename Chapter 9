#1) We've said nothing in this chapter about whether you can pass tuples
#as arguments to a function. Construct a small python example to test whether
#this is possible, and write up your findings

#not possible

#2)Is a pair a generalisation of a tuple, or is a tuple a generalisation of a pair?
#-> a pair is a generalisation of a tuple

#3)Is a pair a kind of tuple, or is a tuple a kind of pair
#-> A pair is a kind of tuple.
